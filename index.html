            The series follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher,
            who is struggling to make ends meet for his family. After being
            diagnosed with terminal cancer, White turns to a life of crime,
            producing and selling meth with the help of former student, Jesse
            Pinkman, in order to secure his family's financial future. Over the
            course of the show's five seasons, White transforms from a meek and
            mild-mannered teacher into a ruthless drug lord, leading to a
            downward spiral that has disastrous consequences for those around
            him.
